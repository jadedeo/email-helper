## Requirements

This extension is intended for desktop use. It utilizes Manifest 3 & is supported by Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.)

In order to use the mailTo feature, users must configure a default mail app for their desktop.

To build and run the application, users must first install [npm & NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm); they should follow the downloading instructions according to their operating system.

## Installing Dependencies

To generate a production version of the extension that can be loaded into the browser, navigate into the app repo via the terminal/command line & run the following command.

```bash
$ npm install && npm run build
```

Within the app repo, you should now see a 'dist' folder.
